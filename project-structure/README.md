# Project Structure for all my projects (I made this, so feel free to disagree)

I don't have super strict structure to follow, but I do want to a consistent one

I have taken look at many structures some from sources that is saying that the structure is the "official" or the "most correct" way of settings things up. Obviously, I disagree, I think file structures should be one that is helping the project which can vary depending on languages, frameworks, the goal, and the size of the project (I am looking at Go's standards, in which for me does not help for different types of projects and especially after go modules are introduced)

I like things to be simple and clear, so I try to make this as clear as possible

There are two ways I usually structure my code, which is similar to OOP's inheritance vs composition.

Directories based on functionalities and Directories based on parent

I like things simple so I usually have one main / index file in src or just the project directory
