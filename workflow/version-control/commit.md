# Commit Message on version control

This is a rule of thumb for myself and others that are interested, note that nothing here is absolutes and this is very opinionated

## Rules

### 1. Commit title must be clear and explains in short what the commit is
- It should not be vague i.e `Made some changes`, `Something happend`, etc.
- It should be clear what happened even without reading the rest of the message
- It should not be too long 
- Add emojis, unicode characters to emphasize points. However should always still have readable text

### 2. Commit message description should detail changes 
- Commit message description should be either detailing changes with context or explaining what happened as paragraph
- Should not be a copy paste of the git changes as it is blind to the context of the changes
- Not too long
- If not needed, remove it

### 3. Git commits must be useful for rollbacks and showing progress
- Should never commit too much file changes that aren't related as a commit
- Commit each context
- Commit parts / progress for rollback and history
